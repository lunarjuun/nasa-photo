# Nasa APOD Project

This is my project showcasing the photo of the day on NASA's website.

## Function
The project is very straight forward and uses an API to retrieve information from NASA's website to display the daily changing astronomy photo of the day.'

### Obstacles
- I had issues with getting the APOD to show on days where it was a video (ex. august 26), and I have yet to fix it unfortunately.
- The font changer button was a feedback from someone else who said it could be difficult to read for some, so I took that into account and made a toggle button.

### Measures Taken For User Accessibility
- Made sure the font contrast well with the background
- Since I wanted a font on the website, I considered that it might not be legible for everyone, so I made a button to toggle it back to sans serif.
- The website works on both mobile and desktop when inspecting.
